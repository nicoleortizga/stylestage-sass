# Style Stage

> A minimal starter for Style Stage submissions that includes the source Sass used to create the base Style Stage theme, and the source HTML.


Style Stage is a project maintained by @5t3ph as a showcase of modern CSS. I used this template to contribute the Plants on Pink stylesheet.
